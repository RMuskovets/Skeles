# Skeles
Skeles is a hobby OS with VESA/VBE support and GRUB booting.

# Screenshots
None yet.

# I see that's not entirely your code!
Yes, that's true. I've started from the OSdev "Meaty Skeleton".

# License
The license is GNU GPL 3.0, which means you can use the code in any purposes as long as you provide access to original sources.

# I want to try it!
The ISOs are not in the repository - you can build them yourself (using `iso.sh` script) or wait for one at the Releases tab.

# How to contribute?
Fork the repo and send PRs to me - I'll try to merge the most relevant ones.

# Roadmap
I plan to:
 * [x] To use 1024x768 video mode
 * [ ] To do memory management
 * [ ] To create FAT32 or Ext2 filesystem driver.
 * [ ] To setup GDT/IDT? (I don't know does the GRUB)
 * [ ] To create fancy GUIs
